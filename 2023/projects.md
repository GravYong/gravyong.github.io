## Interfacial mode and dynamical tides

1. Relativistic calculation of i-modes of stratified NSs (including g-mode spectrum), observational consequences in EM and GW

2. Exploring nuclear parameters with dynamical tides of i/g modes

## BHNS merger with different nuclear parameters

1. update the SACRA code to accept 2D and 3D EOS

2. update the primitive recovery scheme 

3. run the BHNS simulations and test the results

## Finite temperature effect in neutron star mergers

1. Compare the constant Gamma thermal and tabulated ones

2. A parametrized scheme of the finite-temperature EOS

## Mergers with QSs: binary QSs waveform and BH-QS mergers

1. BHQS merger, maybe no dynamical ejecta, a clean method to rule out QSs, or completely different

## binary mergers with pre-merger phase transition 

1. Still in consideration, not sure about the final results, but I want to test 

## Perturbation study in massive scalar-tensor gravity (I,lambda,Q,f,phi-mode)

1. study the universal relation and prospects in GW science

## Rotating and tidally-deformed solid strange stars

1. Solid perturbation formalism and application as a first step: deviations in scalar tensor gravity


## A timing template for precessing magnetar

1. I need a clean model, not too sophisticated

## Other collaborations:

1. Thermal aspects of binary NS merger (second author)

2. Dynamical-tides eigenfunction analysis 

3. Scalar tensor waveform (together, I will finish the derivation of the perturbation Eqs)
