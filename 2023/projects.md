# Ongoing projects

## Interfacial mode and dynamical tides

1. Relativistic calculation of i-modes of stratified NSs (including g-mode spectrum), observational consequences in EM and GW

2. Exploring nuclear parameters with dynamical tides of i/g modes

## BHNS merger with different nuclear parameters

1. update the SACRA code to accept 2D EOS

2. update the primitive recovery scheme 

3. run the BHNS simulations and test the results

## CFS instability: window and simulation

1. f-mode CFS instability window and damping time

2. Simulations of CFS instability

# Ongoing tests

## Mergers with QSs: BH-QS mergers

1. BHQS merger, maybe no dynamical ejecta, a clean method to rule out QSs, or completely different

## binary mergers with pre-merger phase transition 

1. Test simulations: dynamical ejecta and phase transition 

## Supernova formation of quark stars

1. think about how to set the process

2. collaborate with Takami Kuroda 

## Collaborations:

1. Thermal aspects of binary NS merger (second author, nearly finished)

2. Dynamical-tides eigenfunction analysis 

3. Scalar tensor waveform (together, I will finish the derivation of the perturbation Eqs)

# Still in mind, only work on when I have nothing to do 

## Finite temperature effect in neutron star mergers (hold on)

1. Compare the constant Gamma thermal and tabulated ones

2. A parametrized scheme of the finite-temperature EOS

## Rotating and tidally-deformed solid strange stars (hold on)

1. Solid perturbation formalism and application as a first step

## Perturbation study in massive scalar-tensor gravity (I,lambda,Q,f,phi-mode) (hold on)

1. study the universal relation and prospects in GW science 

## A timing template for precessing magnetar

1. I need a clean model, not too sophisticated
